# Setup file

This needs to be the first thing that runs. It will take care of the usernames, the sudo passwords, etc things required while processing commands. 

## What information do we need?

For now we're sticking with these:

1. username (and hence use absolute path always)
2. sudo password
3. operating system

If more is needed then we can always edit the scripts.
