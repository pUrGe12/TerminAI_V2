# Json generator model

This is the main json generator. This will take in the user input (and eventually the history) which it will use to make a json type object of all the necessary files.

## API Keys

We're using enviornment varibles for the API keys.

## Init prompts

The prompt is defined in a seperate file named [address](./address.py).
